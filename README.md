# Resume-Website

This is my personal resume project, and I spent roughly 25 hours on it. I understand this is not perfect and by  **no means claim to be perfect.**  


**Credits to:** W3c for help with code and ChatGPT for giving me examples and support. 


This site includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used libraries from Awsome Icons and Anamite CSS to help with the making.
